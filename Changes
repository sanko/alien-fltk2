    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Correcting c+p bug in gl test
          See cpantesters.org/cpan/report/5856497a-ba06-11df-b6d3-36bb8fbefd91
     * When fltk2_gl disabled, do not attempt to build fltk2_glut lib either
     * Work around a bug in v5.12.1 of 32bit Strawberry Perl which places some
          headers under ...strawberry\c\i686-w64-mingw32\include\ without
          adding the directory to $Config{incpath} or even $Config{userinc}.
          This was causing such systems to miss GL during configure.
     * Build against fltk2's mainline SVN revision 7680
     * Improved (I hope) library archiver search for MinGW-based systems

Version 0.06970024 | 2010-09-04 04:21:58Z (Sat, 04 Sep 2010) | 978608d

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Undertested GL build fix
     * ExtUtils::CBuilder tacks perl's CORE include dir on when compiling so
          the config.h we generate for FLTK2 was left unused and caused
          problems w/MinGW
          See cpantesters.org/cpan/report/07665931-b19f-3f77-b713-d32bba55d77f

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * New GL test

          See STR #1890

     * Untested config fix for OSX

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Un(der)tested CygWin configuration and build fixes

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * examples/0001_synopsis.pl had a fail-worthy typo

    Notes:
     * For now, we only support Win32-ish CygWin builds. In the future, we may
       include X11-like builds. But don't count on it.

Version 0.06970018 | 2010-02-13 16:55:35Z (Sat, 13 Feb 2010) | dee91f4

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Rather than X11, OSX/Darwin uses Carbon for graphics so we no longer
       search for X11-related libs

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * The XCursor lib is now noted as being optional in POD and README

    Notes:
     * This dist also includes other OS X 'fixes' which are completly untested
       and will probably fail

Version 0.06970017 | 2010-02-10 07:20:11Z (Wed, 10 Feb 2010) | 71318bc

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:

Version 0.06970016 | 2010-02-09 21:08:50Z (Tue, 09 Feb 2010) | 6ca8824

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Alien::FLTK has been split into two projects. See Notes below.
     * cflags() and cxxflags() no longer include list of include directories
     * Renamed include_path() => include_dirs() now that it returns all
          required include directories
     * Internal method config('blah') now returns blah's data in the config
          hash
     * Compile using Quartz drawing instead of X11 on Apple OS X
     * Four months of stuff I forgot to keep the changelog up to date for. You
           could check out the commit logs if you're bored.

    Notes:
     * Alien::FLTK has been split into two projects. The first, Alien::FLTK
           will now build the stable 1.3.x branch of FLTK while Alien::FLTK2
           will build the 2.0.x branch.

Version 0.06921 | 2009-10-11 05:50:42Z (Sun, 11 Oct 2009) | 335da88

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Upgrading to r6921
     * include_path() and library_path() methods are (hopefully) less flimsey
     * Slightly better platform handling

Version 0.06916 | 2009-10-11 05:50:42Z (Sun, 11 Oct 2009) | 335da88

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * lib/header checks (should) now work on Unix
     * configure action /should/ work on Solaris

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Upgrading to r6916
     * We configure fltk before creating Build script in case we run into
          trouble (typically missing libs on *nix) and need to exit(0) so test
          results in NA

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * Full OO syntax is now used in docs, tests, and examples
     * Trimmed down t/0000_use/0002_exe.t so tests don't fail under tunneled X11

    Notes:
     * I'll get this right eventually... ((sigh))

Version 0.06879 | 2009-10-04 04:46:04Z (Sun, 04 Oct 2009) | b9cf221

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * None yet

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * More spitballing with *nix

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * capabilities() and config() methods are now documented

    Notes:
     * Upgrading to fltk2 r6858 which comes with a modified license which
         remains "in the spirit of the original FLTK 2 license, but at the
         same time [complies with] Debian license requirements."

Version 0.06844 | 2009-09-03 05:03:50Z (Thu, 03 Sep 2009) | 7ea0002

     Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * It actually works (...on Windows, at least)

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Alternatives are presented when we fail to download fltk's source
     * Building fltk2 using ExtUtils::CBuilder and manual configuration

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * New GL example: example/0003_gl.pl
     * Adding list of prerequisites for non-Win32 systems

    Notes:
     * With the required X11-related libs installed, Alien::FLTK builds and
         tests just fine on my Xubuntu box but I've received nothing but
         FAIL-mail from CPAN Testers on non-Win32 systems. ...I'll take
         suggestions from any *nix knowledgeable person who'd like to help.
